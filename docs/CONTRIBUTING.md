[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

How to become a contributor?
======

Way 1:
----

Make a fork of the project. 
Do changes. 
Cover them with:
- unit tests;
- functional tests.
Propose a PR to merge your fork into the main projet and make sure you have added a good description what you were trying to solve/improve and your changes are not breaking changes in terms of API/functionality.

Way 2:
----

Almost the same as "Way 1" except you shouldn't do your fork. 
Ping the owner of the project directly with the ask to be added as a contributor.
Wait a moment or slitly longer.
Receive confirmation and be ready to make project better by your commits.

Issues
======

We has 'Issues' tab which intended to post tasks/issues to the project there.
No any other work could come except through new issues created officially for the project.

Pull requests
======

Any changes to the master branch will go through Pull Request review. 
Please prepare your PR, ensure that it passes all tests. Ask for review of it. Address comments you will get during PR.
Be calm.

Wiki
======

We already have basic information on the project stored under wiki tab. We have to support it and ensure that if you do changes to the project which are affecting already existing documentation then please make regarding changes into wiki documents we have.
